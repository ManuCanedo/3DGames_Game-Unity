# University Projects

<p align="justify">
These are some of the projects I did during college. They are a sample of the code that I wrote during my studies in Telecommunications Engineering at the University of Vigo.

Particularly interesting to me is the research *Inharmonicity in Classical Guitar Strings*. It was self-motivated research that I carried out in parallel with my studies, in collaboration with one of the university professors. I used its results as my final degree project.
