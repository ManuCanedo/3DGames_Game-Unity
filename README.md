This was my first approach ever to the games development world. I helped a group of classmates to bootstrap their project by writing a story for their game (related to a Saramago book's fragment), characters arcs and some leit-motivic music. The story and base idea got widely accepted so I continued volunteeringly working in it with the team for a couple of months more (2 meetings per week). My contributions to the actual development were:

-Terrain Design and prototyping.
-Music and SFX desing.
-Audio Implementation.
