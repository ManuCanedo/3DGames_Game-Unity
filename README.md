# Xesus De Redondela (Gamejam As Meninas 2020) - Wwise Audio

Sandbox Shooter developed in the last gamejam.

In this game you are "Jesus from Redondela" a local neighbour from the town of Redondela in charge of protecting the fjord from unsustainable fishing. You have some interesting miraculous abilities that will allow you to accomplish your goal.

After finishing the jam I started redoing the audio implementation using Wwise looking for a realistic ambience.

I did the **game concept and implementation** (game mechanics, AI, visuals effects...). 3D modelling and menus by Fran Baez and Bruno Platero.
Development time: 3 days.

# Solar System Simulation

Unity 3D environement that shows the planets orbiting around the Sun. The distances between objects and size of the sun have been rescaled logaritmically. The orbit speeds and spins are linearly rescalated and maintain a realistic relation. To change the camera view click on the planets and the sun. 

The most pleasant part of this project is that the planets are 3D sound sources for the tracks of Us and Them from Pink Floyd. The listener is located at the sun and reorients towards the planets when you click on them. This means that the audio tracks slowly orbit around you, the listener, and that the panning/3D spatialization changes every time you click on a planet to change the view.
